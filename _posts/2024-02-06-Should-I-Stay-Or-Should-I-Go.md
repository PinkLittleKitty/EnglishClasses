Should is used for multiple things, but the most common is:

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Giving Advice:</span> We can use **Should** to give advice and make suggestions to do something or express that something is a good idea.



* You should try this dessert, it’s so delicious! 

We can use **Shouldn’t**, which is the contraction of _should + not_, to give advice and make suggestions not to do something or express that something is a bad idea.



* This dessert is too sweet, you shouldn’t even try it, or else you’re gonna pall. 

_(Small tangent, “Pall” means “Empalagar”, and “Gonna” is a contraction of “Going to”, used in spoken english, there are a bunch like this one, “Wanna” is “Want to”, “Gotta” is “Going to”, “Ain’t” is “be or have not”)_

We can use **Should + Have + Past Participle** to make suggestions about something that has already happened in the past.



* We Shouldn’t have drunk coffee before going to bed.

Obligation: We can use **should** in the meaning of _be supposed to_ or _be expected to_ to give orders or advice but not in a strong way.



* You should study harder.

Note: We can use ought to/ought not to instead of should/shouldn’t. There is no difference between them, although ought to is less common and more formal than should.



* You ought to study harder.
