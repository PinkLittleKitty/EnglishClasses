# Pharasal verbs, and their word order:

Phrasal verbs are made of a verb plus one or two particles.

> My cat **wakes* me **up** every morning.

>The noise is terrible. I can't **put up with** it any longer.

The particles modify the meaning of the verb, sometimes just slightly, but sometimes more greatly.

>I **brought** my children (Bring = transportar a donde vos estÃ¡s)

>I **brought** my children **up** (Bring up = educar o criar)
 
>I can't **tell** him and his brother. (Tell = decir algo a)

>I can't **tell** Tim and his brother **apart**. (Tell apart = diferenciar entre dos personas)

In terms of word order, there are two types of phrasal verbs: *separable* and *inseparable.*

## Separable phrasal verbs
Separable phrasal verbs are transitive (Which means they take a direct object). The ofject is underliuned below. You can put the object between the verb and the particle, separating them:

>She **took** <ins>the rubbish</ins> **out**.

Or you can keep the verb and particle together, and put the object after the particle:

>She **took out** <ins>the rubbish</ins>.

Both ways have the same meaning. However, when the object is a pronoun, only the separated form can be used, the verb must go between the verb and particle.

>She **took** <ins>it</ins> **out.**

>~~She **took <ins>it</ins> out**~~.

Even though the separated and unseparated forms are both gramatically correct (Except when pronouns are used), in certain contexts, one form is preffered over the other.

Separation is preferred in spoken english if the speaker stresses the particle with their voice.

>**Take <ins>that rubbish</ins> OUT!** (Take OUT <ins>that rubbish</ins> is also possible, but less preferred.)

>Don't **turn <ins>the volume</ins> UP**, turn it DOWN! (Don't turn UP <ins>the volume</ins> is also possible, but less preferred.)

On the other hand, keeping the verb and particle together is preferred if the object is long or structurally complex.

>It's my job to **sort out <ins>any kind of problem ocurring in out company's computer systems</ins>**.

>She **took out <ins>all the rubbish from the party</ins>**.

## Inseparable phrasal verbs
Some phrasal verbs cannot be separated at all. For some verbs, this is because they are intransive (which means they can't take a direct object.)

>My job isn't very well paid but it gives me enough to **get by**.

>I **grew up** in London.

Other inseparable phrasal verbs can take an object. If they have a preposition as a particle, the phrasal verbs is always inseparable because the objet must follow the preposition.

>I **came up with <ins>a great idea</ins>**.

>~~I **came up <ins>a great idea</ins> with.**~~

This is also true when using a pronoun.

>I've got a great idea! I **came up with <ins>it</ins>** just now.

>~~I've got a great idea! I **came up <ins>it</ins> with** just now.~~

However, the direct object may appear earlier in the sentence.

>I want to tell you about <ins>a great idea</ins> that **I came up with**.

>You're a great role model for your younger brother. He's lucky to have **<ins>you</ins> to look up to.**
