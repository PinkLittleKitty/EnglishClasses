## 12C - The english file quiz

Questions without auxiliaries, you surely heard them, but maybe you don't know why or when they are used.

### When do we use them?


| Wh- word | Auxiliary | Subject | Verb |
|---------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| When | did | he | paint it? |
| What | do | you | want?
| What | does | the city | offer? |
| Where | does | she | go? |

The above is the way we usually make questions, auxiliary, then subject.

But, if we use the subject as the first part of the question, we end up with a non auxiliary question.

| Subject | Verb |  |
|---------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| How many people | live | near the school? |
| Which city | has | the most people? |
| Who | wants | a cup of coffe? |
| Who | directed | Star Wars? |

We use them when the question word itself IS the subject, and, in this cases, the verb needs to be cojugated.
