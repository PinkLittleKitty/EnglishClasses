## 12B - Think before you speak

Reported speech is when we tell someone what another person said. To do this, we can use direct speech or indirect speech.

> Direct Speech: "I work in a bank", said Daniel
> Indirect Speech: Daniel said that he worked in a bank.

In indirect speech, we often use a tense wich is "further back" in the past than the tense originally used. This is called "backshift". We also may need to change other words that were used, for example, pronouns.

### Present simple, present continuous and present perfect

When we backshift, present simple changes to past simple, present continuous changes to past continuous, and present perfect changes to past perfect.

> "I travel a lot in my job" /
> She said that she travelled a lot in her job.
>
> "The baby's sleeping!" /
> He told me the baby was sleeping.
>
> "I've hurt my leg." /
> She said she'd hurt her leg.

### Past simple and past continuous

When we backshift, past simple usually changes to past perfect simple, and past continuous usually changes to past perfect continuous.

> "We lived in China for five years." /
> She told me they'd lived in China for five years.
>
> "It was raining all day."
> He told me it had been raining all day.

### Past perfect

The past perfect doesn't change.

> "I'd tried everything without success, but this new medicine is great" /
> He said he'd tried everything without success, but the new medicine was great.

### No Backshift

If what the speaker has said is still true or relevant, it's not always necessary to change the tense. This might happen when the speaker has used a present tense.

> "I go to the gym next to your house." /
> Jenny told me that she goes to the gym next to my house. I'm thinking about going with her.
>
> "I'm working in Italy for the next six months." /
> He told me he's working in Italy for the next six months. Maybe I should visit him!
>
> "I've broken my arm!" /
> She said she's broken her arm, so she won't be at work this week.
