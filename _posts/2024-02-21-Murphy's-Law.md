## 8B - Murphy’s Law (Conditionals)

The first conditional is the conditional that is used to talk about a possible condition and probable result. Aka, we propose situations that will most likely come true in the future.

also known as (También conocido como)

**Uses of the first conditional:**

The first conditional is used to talk about plans that the person has. Imagine you want to plan out a vacation, but for it to become a reality, some conditions have to happen. In this case, you have to use the first conditional.

* If I save enough money, I will go to the beach. (Si ahorro suficiente plata, voy a ir a la playa.)
* If she passes the exam, she will travel abroad. (Si ella aprueba el examen, viajará al extranjero.)

**Structure of the First conditional:** \
The first conditional necessarily has two clauses: The condition and the result. One of them should be written in the simple present and the other in the simple future. Like the zero conditional, clauses can be used in interchangeable order.

The condition clause has the following structure:

**If + subject + present simple,**

The second clause is the result clause and it’s formed with:

**Subject + will + infinitive verb**

**First conditional in affirmative form:**

The first English conditional in the affirmative must include a clause in the present simple and another clause in the future simple. Structure:

**If + Subject + simple present, Subject + Will + infinitive verb**

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Examples:</span>



* If my family buys the land, we will build a house. (Si mi familia compra la tierra, vamos a construir una casa.)
* We will build a house if my family buys the land. (Vamos a construir una casa si mi familia compra la tierra.)

**First conditional in negative form:**

The first conditional can also be used in the negative. In this case it is necessary to include the negative formula _doesn’t_ or _don’t_ in the clause that includes the “if”. Structure:

**If + Subject + do/does not + present simple, Subject + will + not + infinitive verb**

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Examples:</span>



* If you don’t drive carefully, you will have an accident. (Si no manejás con cuidado, vas a tener un accidente.)
* You will have an accident if you don’t drive carefully. (Vas a tener un accidente si no manejás con cuidado.)

**First conditional in interrogative form:**

The first conditional in interrogative form is very simple. Simply what you should do is reverse the order of the clauses. That is, the first will be the future clause and the second will be the condition. Structure:

**Will + Subject + infinitive verb + if + subject + present simple verb + ?**

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Examples:</span>



* Will you buy me an ice cream if I clean my room? (Me comprarás un helado si limpio mi pieza?)
* Will he pick you up if it is too late? (Te va a ir a buscar si es demasiado tarde?)
