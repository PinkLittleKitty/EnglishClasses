**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Obligations</span>**

There are multiple ways of conveying obligations, but the most common way is Must and Have To.

Let’s start with Must!

Must is a modal verb, so, it’s followed by the base form of the infinitive (Without to.)

Another thing: You NEVER put an s at the end of the verb.

Examples:



* You must to go. INCORRECT
* You must go.
* He must waits. INCORRECT
* He must wait.

Example sentences:

* I must study.
* He must wear a helmet when he rides his bike.
* She must see a doctor before it gets worse.
* They must follow the rules.

What is must used for?

It’s used to express obligation or duty, and also refers to complying with rules, laws, and regulations.



* You **must** wear a seatbelt at all times.

It’s also used to emphasize the necessity of something.



* Plants **must** have light and water to grow.

It's also used for deduction, when you’re sure something is true.



* Look at all of that snow. It **must** be really cold outside.

It’s also used to express positive logical assumptions about the past. (Must + have + past participle.)



* He **must have won** the lottery with the new house and car he has just bought.

It’s also used for strong recommendations or advice.



* The cupcakes here are delicious. You **must** try one.

The negative of **_Must_** is **_Mustn’t_**

**Mustn’t** is a contraction, or short way of saying **Must not**.

**Mustn’t** is a negative obligation. It is important that you do NOT do something.

In a way, **mustn’t** is the same as saying it is prohibited or it is not allowed.

Sometimes, HAVE TO is used instead of MUST

For example:



* I must write a letter to john.
* I have to write a letter to john.

We generally use **must** when the speaker decides that something is necessary, or needs to be done.

In this case I have decided that I need to write a letter to John. Nobody else has told me to write it. I think it is necessary.

We use **have to** when somebody else other than the speaker has made the decision.

So here, I didn’t decide to write a letter. Somebody else has told me to write it, somebody else told me it was necessary to do.

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Different tenses:</span>**

The past tense of Must is Had to:



* I had to pay my speeding ticket yesterday.
* She had to give a presentation to her boss.

The future tense of Must is Will have to:



* I will have to leave work early tomorrow.

In spoken English we would use the contraction I’ll instead of I will. I’ll have to leave…

However, sometimes Must is also used to express future obligation.



* I must leave work early tomorrow

Though the version with will have to is much more common.
